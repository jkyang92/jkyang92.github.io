  <h2 class="content-heading"> About Me </h2>
  <p>I am a Research Assistant Professor at Vanderbilt University, working Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry.</p>

  <p> My recent research focuses on multigraded syzygies, in particular 
    virtual resolutions. But I also have a strong interest in syzygies more 
    broadly as well as connections between Algebraic Geometry, Commutative 
    Algebra, and Combinatorics. For my papers and preprints, see the 
    research tab.</p>
